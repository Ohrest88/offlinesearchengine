# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

To keep the project open source (GPLv3) and also allow the maintainer to ship official builds on app stores, we use a simple Contributor License Grant (CLG). **By opening a pull request, you agree to this CLG.**

## Contributor License Grant (CLG)

By submitting any code, documentation, or other material to this repository (“Contribution”), you agree:

1) **Public License (GPLv3).** You license your Contribution to the public under the Project’s license, currently **GPLv3** (see `LICENSE`).

2) **Additional License to the Maintainer (for official binaries).** You grant the Project maintainer (“Maintainer”) a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free** license to use, modify, combine, **sublicense**, and **relicense** your Contribution **as part of official binaries** (e.g., distributions via app stores) under terms different from GPLv3.

   *This does not grant any additional rights to third parties. It only allows the Maintainer to distribute official builds where GPLv3 is impractical (e.g., due to store terms).*

3) **Representations.** You confirm you have the right to contribute and license the Contribution as above, and that to your knowledge it does not infringe third-party rights.

If you do not agree with this CLG, please do not submit a pull request.
